                            $30.00 per month for Students/Kids. The fees are the same regardless of the number of
                            practices attended per month. Registration at Tateyama entitles you to participate in
                            all three martial arts programs we offer.The only other mandatory dues which a Tateyama
                            member must pay are to the Canadian Kendo

                        <h3>How do I apply to become a member?</h3>
                        <p>Any person interested in becoming a member of Tateyama must first contact a dojo
                            representative and express their intention to begin the application process. Once this
                            is done, arrangements will be made with the dojo representative, to begin the following
                            process:Observe an entire regular practice. This will give you an idea of what typical
                            training
                            entails and the physical demands required.</p>
                        <p>Attend 3 trial practices free of any charge. During these practices you will be
                            introduced to the basic concepts and fundamental techniques of the discipline and will
                            allow you the chance to experience the budo first-hand. These practices take place on
                            Sunday (3:00 pm-4:00 p.m.)</p>
                        <p>If you are still interested you can apply to become a member.</p>

                    <p>No. We do not have contracts, however our registration is structured around 3
                        month
                        period, so fees are paid quarterly.</p>

                    <p>Not at this time. However there are Francophone members within the club who
                        can help
